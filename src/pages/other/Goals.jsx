    heading: "Staking $SIGN",
    body: (
      <>
        The Sign Super App's staking program, centered on the $SIGN token, allows users to lock tokens for a 7-day
        minimum to earn rewards and benefits. With a 10% annual percentage rate (APR), staking offers competitive
        passive income, potentially yielding 100 $SIGN per 1,000 staked annually, though returns depend on token price
        stability. The process likely involves a web interface (e.g., app.ethsign.xyz/staking), where users connect
        wallets to stake, with rewards claimable periodically, offering flexibility due to the short unstaking period.
        Benefits of Staking: A unique role in the app (possibly a status or governance privilege). Exclusive early
        access to new releases. Recognition as a "certified orange builder" tied to the "Orange Dynasty" branding. These
        benefits aim to foster community engagement and loyalty, potentially offering priority in app features or
        events. However, the tangible value of these perks, like the role or early access, remains unclear without
        details on the app's functionality or roadmap, making it critical to verify their utility. Risks to Consider:
        Token price volatility. Network issues. Underwhelming app releases reducing the value of rewards and benefits.
        Surprise community-driven releases, like airdrops or NFTs, could enhance returns, but their impact depends on
        execution. Users should research the Sign Super App's ecosystem, roadmap, and $SIGN's market performance before
        staking, as the pre-launch stage adds speculative risk.
